## ❓ Q&A Cheat Sheet

**Q: How does real-time updating work?**
A: We use Firebase Firestore's onSnapshot listeners to provide real-time updates for events, RSVPs, and comments without requiring manual refresh.

**Q: What security measures are implemented?**
A: Firebase Authentication handles secure login, Firestore security rules prevent unauthorized access, input validation prevents injection attacks, and role-based permissions control event creation.

**Q: How does offline functionality work?**
A: Events are cached locally using AsyncStorage. Users can browse cached events offline, but real-time features require connectivity.

**Q: Can you explain the role system?**
A: Two roles exist: 'user' (can view, RSVP, comment) and 'organizer' (can also create and manage events). Roles are assigned during registration.

**Q: How scalable is this architecture?**
A: Firebase handles scaling automatically. The component architecture allows easy feature additions. Real-time listeners could be optimized for very large user bases.

**Q: What about cross-platform compatibility?**
A: Built with React Native and Expo, the app runs identically on iOS, Android, and web browsers from a single codebase.

**Q: How do you handle different screen sizes?**
A: Responsive design uses flexible layouts, percentage-based sizing, and platform-specific adaptations for optimal viewing on all devices.

**Q: What testing strategies are used?**
A: Unit tests for critical functions, manual testing checklist, real device testing, and user acceptance testing scenarios.

**Q: How are images handled?**
A: Firebase Storage manages image uploads with automatic compression and CDN delivery for optimal performance.

**Q: What about data privacy?**
A: Minimal data collection, Firebase's enterprise-grade security, GDPR compliance features, and user control over personal information.

**Q: How would you add push notifications?**
A: Firebase Cloud Messaging integration for event reminders, comment notifications, and new event alerts based on user preferences.

**Q: What's the deployment process?**
A: Expo build service creates app binaries for app store deployment. Web version can be hosted on any static hosting service.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Authentication Security
- Firebase handles secure password hashing and storage
- JWT tokens for session management
- Automatic token refresh prevents unauthorized access
- Password strength validation implemented

### Data Security
- Firestore security rules prevent unauthorized access
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based permission system
- API rate limiting through Firebase

### Client-Side Security
- No sensitive data stored locally
- Secure token storage using Expo SecureStore
- Input validation on all forms
- XSS prevention through proper data handling

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load as needed
- **Image Optimization**: Compressed images with caching
- **Real-time Efficiency**: Targeted listeners reduce bandwidth
- **Offline First**: Cached data for immediate loading
- **Memory Management**: Proper component cleanup
